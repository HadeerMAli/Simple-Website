        <h2><strong><ins>The Size and Shape of the Universe</ins></strong></h2>

           <h3>The first systematic theory of the size and shape of the universe 
            that attempted to explain observed data was constructed by Ptolemy in the 2d cent.
            In this theory the solar system was thought to be the entire universe, with the earth 
            at its center and the distant stars located just beyond the farthest planet. 
            This belief was held until the 16th cent., when Copernicus advanced the idea that the sun,
            rather than the earth, is at the center of the system and that the stars are at very 
            great distances compared to the planets. During the first part of the 20th cent., 
            astronomers discovered that the sun is only one of billions of stars in the Milky Way 
            galaxy and is located far from the galactic center.<br />
